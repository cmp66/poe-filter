The goal of this item filter is to highlight only the items worth picking up in maps, such as:
- Valuable uniques
- Currencies
- Maps (color-coded by white/yellow/red)
- Divination cards
- Rare jewelry
- (todo) Rare bases worth picking up
- White sorc boots
- Vendor recipe items (6s, chromatics, quality gem/flasks)

If it's not in the above list, it should be hidden.
